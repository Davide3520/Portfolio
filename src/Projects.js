    description: "Blocks leverages the power of peer-to-peer protocols and the Ethereum Blockchain to offer a storage alternative to traditional, centralized, storage applications (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) When a user uploads a file through Blocks, it is encrypted and stored on the IPFS. This returns a unique content identifier (CID), which can be used to retrieve the encrypted file from the IPFS later. Rather than storing the CIDs in a central, fallible, database, Blocks stores these CIDs on the Ethereum Blockchain.",
